            <h2>Mr. &amp; Mrs.</h2>
            <p><span id="fancy">E</span>mily and Tyler met at New Castle United Methodist Church in elementary school. They began dating seriously November 23, 2012. Soon after Emily graudated with her bachelors degree (January 27th, 2018 to be exact), Tyler took Emily to her favorite mexican resturant in LaGrange, KY. While in LaGrange Tyler suggested that the couple go vist the park where they used to spend time together while Emily was in high school. When they arrived the gazebo in the park was surrounded with candles, rose petals, flowers, and Champane; Tyler had enlsited a few friends to help make this night as magical as possible. The couple slowly walked from the car to the gazebo where Tyler got down on one knee and asked Emily to marry him. She gave him a resounding YES!    </p>
